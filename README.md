This is my personal website.
It includes two non-standard fonts, an animated GIF, and a user input allowing you to name the ghost in said GIF.
It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Although this is technically my personal website, it is mainly a way for me to experiment with website design & features that I have not worked with before.

This means I had to look up a lot of things, so forgive the mess.
I have no clue what I'm doing half the time.
I also asked Chat GPT for help when looking something up proved fruitless, like for example weird bugs around flexbox that made everything above the GIF disappear until you zoomed out to 25%.
